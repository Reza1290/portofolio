                  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;This was the year I met friends who also shared a passion for computers,
                  as well as a senior and teacher (Mr. Dirin and Mr. A. Mukhtar) who <strong>introduced me to Linux</strong>. It was the beginning of my deep dive into the world of open-source software.
                  Around this time, I also got my second laptop, an <strong>ASUS A455LF</strong>, as a reward for getting accepted into one of the top middle schools
                  in Surabaya.

                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I joined an open-source community called <strong>3 FOSS IT</strong>, and I had the privilege of serving as the leader from 8th to 9th grade.
                  Additionally, I was part of the <strong>Youth Scientific Writing extracurricular</strong>, where I developed a love for writing and inventing,
                  expressing my ideas through <strong>abstracts and projects</strong>!

                  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;I&apos;m grateful to have been accepted into Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya, where <strong>I pursued a diploma in Informatics Engineering</strong>. My journey continued to evolve as I participated in several competitions, including UI/UX design and business competitions that won an award, and even wrote a paper. I also earned a national <strong>certification as a Junior Web Developer</strong>.

                <p>
                  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Now, <strong>I find myself creating this website while studying at Hanyang University ERICA as part of the IISMA program</strong>, where I am honored to be an awardee!

                  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;This was the year <strong>I was introduced to computers</strong> by a friend, sparking my interest in the world of technology.
                  At first, it was just gamingâ€”thanks to my friend for showing me the ropes! We spent hours playing Gamehouse classics and
                  even tried out simulators like FlightSim and Train. During this time, I received my first notebook, <strong>the Acer Aspire One</strong>.
                  I was beyond grateful!
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;This period also marked the beginning of my journey into <strong>video editing</strong>.
                  With just a trial version of After Effects, I managed to create my first green screen edits.
                  However, this was also when I encountered my first tech issueâ€”my laptop got stuck in a <strong> boot loop</strong>.
                  That challenge led me to learn how to <strong>create a bootable disk</strong>, and my fascination with computers grew from there.

                  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;In this year, the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic hit</strong>, and I had to study from home. But this became an opportunity for me to dive into how games are made and to <strong>begin learning programming</strong>. I started with the basicsâ€”flowcharts, data typesâ€”and even though I didn&apos;t go too deep, I managed to learn <strong>my first programming language, its C++</strong>.

                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I also continued <strong>submitting abstracts to various competitions</strong>, even though I didn&apos;t make it to the finals.
                  It&apos;s okay, it <strong>was a great learning experience!</strong> This year
                  was also filled with some disappointment, as I was rejected from several of my dream universities.
                  But <strong>I didn&apos;t give up</strong>, and eventually, I found myself at <a href="https://pens.ac.id/" target="_blank" className="font-bold">Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya</a>, which has now become my favorite campus!
